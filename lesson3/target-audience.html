                <h2>Personas</h2>
                <p >Person 1: Michael Stoehr is a young 26 year single man with a Bachelors degree in Business. He runs a fresh produce store in the area. He buys the food from a farmer in town, but is interested in expanding his potential. He is very focused on growing his business so he can buy a house for himself, as right now he simply rents out an apartment. He hears from a customer about this site and decides to check it out on his phone. Michael can be quoted saying, "Life's too short to sit down and do nothing."</p>
                <p> Person 2: Carla Cruz is a 54 year old married woman with two fully grown children, who took over her family's antique shop ever since she got out of highschool and has been running it ever since. She loves the business as it is a piece of history to her, and she loves selling fancy antiques to customers. However, recently the new constructions in town have made her little shop harder to find, therefore resulting in less business. She hears from her daughter about this website and decides to go home and check it on her husband's laptop. Carla can be quoted saying, "In my life I've learned, you can't just wait for someone to pick you up, you have to make the effort yourself."</p>
